# Data-Deseasoning_R
R Script Time Series application.
Deseasoning the Corona data. The decomposition of the trend and cycle.

I used the daily new Corona case time series. I deseasoned the data via taking sevenday avarage, percentage change, and day effect estimated by Leaset Squares. Additionally, I used HP-Filter (the Hodrick-Prescott-Filter) to seperate the trend and cycle.
